## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt how to make use of grid and change my case in html.

```css
.foot{
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
.card{
  display: grid;
  grid-auto-flow: row dense;
}
```

### Continued development

- Use of Grid.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-auto-flow) - This helped me understand the use of grid.
